cluster

# steps for sample ECS
1. create a container
2. create a task(mention the container information and how many)
3. create a service(Give the cluster here)
task
 1) Name
 2) task size

 #Service manages the tasks.
 #Task definition - defines what are specific containers to be part of task
 #Task - It is a running instance of task definition
 #Services - Manages the tasks(containers) - Ensures certain num of tasks are running
 ## We can run/create tasks without service(Batch applications tasks)
 ## We can also schedule the tasks
 #ECS with Ec2 instance
 1) task some memory and agent take few memory on EC2 instance
 2) Task placement
 3) ECS instance Vs Ec2 instance Vs container instance
# Service Events for debugging
