# To process large data we need Spark than Pandas

# 5v of Big Data
   1) volume
   2) velocity
   3) variety
   4) veracity
   5) value

#### Spark has its own map, reduce and filter functions

 ## Spark has everything - It have machine learning, SQL, Real-time processing

## Source --> Ingest --> Process --> Store --> Serve Data

                        1) Mapreduce
                        2) Spark

  # In memory execution
     Data is processed in RAM
  # Lazy execution
     Unless we perform any operation, it won't execute
       --> Action
       --> Transform
  # Parallel Processing

  ## Spark does both Batch and Real time processing(Credit card fraud detection)
  ## RDD -> Resilient Distributed Dataset. which is immutable and follows Lazy transformation
     It has two operations
       1) Transformation : To create a new RDD (e.g. map, groupBy, reduceBy and filter)
       2) Action : Instructs spark to perform computation and send the result back to the driver

      ## Narrow and Wide transformation in spark
         DAG - Directed acyclic Graph

         1) Narrow transformation (pipelining - RDD1 <--> RDD2 ) - No shuffling of data between the nodes (ex filter by age.)
             MAP, FLATMAP MAP PARTITIONS
             filter
             sample
             union
        2) Wide transformation (Shuffling) between Nodes
            Computation is expensive
             Intersection and Join
             Distinct
             Cartesian
             Repartition
             Coalesce
