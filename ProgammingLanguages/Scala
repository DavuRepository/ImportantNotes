#Type Inference
In Scala, you don't require to mention data type and function return type explicitly.
Scala is enough smart to deduce the type of data. The return type of function is determined by the type of last expression present in the function.
# Scala is statically typed - means cannot change
    val a = 400
    val a = "Hello" --- not possible

# lazy val a = {println("evaluated");5}
  -- no lazy var

### very important ******
OpChar  --> _? (OpChar followed by underscore )
backticks --> can also take reserved words

# Scala primitives' can be act as objects also

# FuntionLoops
val result = (1 to 100).reverse.mkString(",")
val result1 = (100 to 1 by -1).mkString(",")


for( a <- 1 to 10 ){
        println(a);
     }
### Strings are object in Scala
// String format
val str = String.format("This is a %s", "Test") // Java style


#### METHODS ######

* Methods are defined using def
* Methods are not Functions
* returns last statement
* Unit - Which is similar to void in java. It has a value ()
*** @tailrec - use tail recursive instead of recursive

# isInstanceOf and AsInstanceOf - No direct casting in scala


### Parameterized Types On Methods (Generics in Java, Templates in C++)

def decide[T](b:Boolean,x:T,y:T):T = if(b) x else y

decide(true,4.0,5.0)  -- returns Double
decide(true,3,"ab")  -- returns Any
decide(true,3,'c')  -- returns Int

############################## OBJECT #############################
  1) Need a Singleton
  2) Need a factory pattern
  3) Need to implement pattern matching logic
  4) If you need a utility method, one that does not require an instance or a state, then you'll use an object.
  5) If you need to set up some kind of default values, then you'll need an object.
  6) And if you need a main method, you'll need an object.


#Singleton object
  In Scala, there are no static variables or methods. Scala uses singleton object, which is essentially class with only one object in the source file. Singleton object is declared by using object instead of class keyword.

Scala Pattern Matching
  Pattern matching is a feature of scala. It works same as switch case in other programming languages. It matches best case available in the pattern.

##Companion objects
Companion objects are still singletons, but they service a class, an abstract class, or a trait, which we won't be able to cover in this video series, but just think of a trait as a structure that has nothing but abstract methods. The rule for a companion object is the object name has to be the same name as the class that it supports. The object and the class also have to be in the same file. What are some of the benefits of a companion class? For one, they can share each other's private information. If the object has private information, the class can have access to it. If the class has private information, the object has access to it. Because of this relationship, the companion object is in a unique position to create instances of a class it supports and perform operations that other objects can't, because of this close relationship.

# The Magic Apply Method
# Infix Operators - Infix operators allow a method to be invoked without the dot or parentheses if there is one method parameter. Now it could also be invoked with two or more parameters without the dot, but we would need the parentheses for it. Mathematical operations in Scala already used in fixed operators, and we've been doing it with add, multiply, subtract, divide, and modulo
# Right-Associative Colons

# Java Options - Some("Anothony") , None -> Nothing

#### Tuples are heterogeneous - Can have upto 22 values



# Call By Name is Lazy (Value evaluated at run time)

# #########Functions##############

# Function1 - It is a "Trait"
# upto Funtion22
# From Scala 2.12 it got changed used as per JDK 8 - Functions will from Util package

              Object Functions extends App
              {

                  /*val f1:Function1[Int,Int] = new Function[Int,Int] {
                    def apply(x:Int) = x+1
                  }

                  val f0:Function0[Int] = new Function0[Int] {
                   def apply(): Int  = 1
                  }

                 */
                  // The above three can also be simplefied as

                  val f1  = (x:Int) => x+1
                  val f0 = () => 1
                  val f2 = (x:Int,y:String) => x+y

                 println(f1.apply(5))
                 println(f1(6))
                 println(f0())
                 println(f2(3,"Wow"))

                  val f3:String => (String,Int) = (x:String) => (x,x.size)
                  println(f3("Venkat"))
              }


# Method or Function
Functions are their own objects. Methods are not functions, and methods belong to a context-- an object, a class, abstract class, trait, et cetera. Again, if it all gets confusing, you always have the choice. You could use an explicit apply. That way it makes it less confusing, and over time you get used to this sort of thing, and everything makes sense.

### CLOUSERS
Closures are just functions that close around the environment. You can use any element within that function that references the outside world in its own context. That's what a closure is. And they are used to make up functions from that environment. And it's also best that you ensure that you enclose around something that is stable, particularly things like val, immutable objects.

### Currying


object MethodorFuction {
  val f = (x:Int) => x+1
  def g(x:Int) = x+1
}

println(MethodorFuction.f.apply(4))
println(MethodorFuction.f(4))
println(MethodorFuction.g.(4))


def squareIt(x:Int):Int = {
  x*x
}

println(squareIt(2))

def transformInt(x:Int, f:Int => Int):Int = {
  f(x)
}

transformInt(3,squareIt)

transformInt(3,x => x*x*x)


####################### COLLECTIONS ###############
List (1 :: 2 :: 3 :: 4 :: Nil)
Set
Map
Arrays and Repeated parameters --->
   Arrays in Scala are converted into primitive arrays on the underlying JVM. Behavior wise in Scala, they are similar to lists. But arrays are mutable, so be careful. Perhaps what you could do is you can convert that into an immutable collection after your use. Repeatable parameters use an array, a wrapped array, to hold the possible extra information.
Ranges

############ COLLECTIONS with Functions ##########
 1) MAP (function)
 2) filter, filterNot, and exists
 3) forEach
 4) flatMap -->
     val a = List(1,2,3,4,5)
    println(a.map(x => List(-x, 0, x)))
    println(a.map(x => List(-x, 0, x)).flatten)
    println(a.flatMap(x => List(-x, 0, x)))
5) For comprehensions -->
    ow, for comprehensions are just a map, flatMap, withFilter, and forEach behind the scenes. They look a lot like for loops, but they're not. For one, they could be assigned to a value. They return collections, like sets, lists, options, et cetera. And any object that has a map, a flatMap, withFilter, or a filter, and for each-- they can be used inside of a for comprehension.
