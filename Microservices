Advantages -
1) Adaption of new technologies and process
2) Dynamic scaling(cloud enabled)
3) Faster release cycles(new features to market)

# Rest/Autonomous Service, Individually deployable and cloud enabled

#Design patterns
1) Aggregation pattern
2) Distributed tracing pattern
3) Circuit breaker
4) Blue- Green deployment

There are many other patterns used with microservice architecture, like Sidecar, Chained Microservice,
Branch Microservice, Event Sourcing Pattern, Continuous Delivery Patterns, and more

ECS Fargate
----------------
#Connecting the DB
  1) Configure the environment variables of DB the container(Task)
  2) Create an RDS and create security Group(attach to RDS), this security group should allow access from the application(that is using RDS)
#communication between two Services
  1) Both should be on same network
  2) communicate to the second service by setting the URL in ENVIROMENT variable
  3)Two services can be run using same Task(Same container)
#Parameter Store (In System Manager)
  1) All the configuration information(names/values of environment variables) is maintained here
  2) Centralized configuration management
#AWS - X-RAY ---> Distributed tracing system
 1) pom.xml - aws-xray-recorder-sdk-spring
 2) AwsXrayConfig.java
 3) XRayInspector.java
 @RestController
 @XRayEnabled
 public class CurrencyExchangeController {
